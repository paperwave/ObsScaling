## Observational Scaling Laws

We will release our code by the end of May including:
* Our collected metadata and evaluation results for nearly 100 public pretrained models and instruction-tuned models
* Code for fitting observational scaling laws for scaling analyses
* Code and guidelines for selecting representative model subsets for low-cost scaling analyses 

Stay tuned!
